# Youtube Search Engine
In this project, I am using the Youtube data API v3. This is the first project where i have used a third party API. Youtube gives us the ability to search, upload and publish all sorts of videos on their servers; but in this project I am focusing only on the search API. So, Youtube still provides v2 of data API, but we are using the latest one to learn more. The search box will be animated which is another piece of javascript code that is implemented during the project.I have used the `channelList` and `searchList` methods as well as `fancyBox plugin` to open videos. The previous and next page functionality is also included.
The most challenging but fun part is making the GET request using $.get() and looping through the result set and dynamically inserting it into the HTML. Some fundamental concepts here are using the jQuery *animate()* method for the search bar and using the API Page Tokens.
